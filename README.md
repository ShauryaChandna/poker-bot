  - Fine-tunes policy and adapts dynamically to player tendencies  
- Opponent Modeling:
  - Tracks VPIP, PFR, Fold%, Aggression Factor, and Showdown win rate  
  - Builds and updates behavioral profiles in real-time  
- Monte Carlo Simulation:
  - Fast rollouts for hand equity estimation  
  - Range-vs-range strength evaluation

## 🧪 Development Phases

| Phase | Status | Description | Bot Intelligence |
|-------|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **1️⃣ Core Engine** | ✅ **COMPLETE** | Deck, dealing, pot-limit logic, state management | 🤖 Can play by rules |
| **2️⃣ Simulation Layer** | ✅ **COMPLETE** | Monte Carlo equity calculator with caching | 🧮 Can calculate odds |
| **3️⃣ Opponent Modeling** | ✅ **COMPLETE** | Player profiling, ML range predictor (87.3% acc), HU-calibrated | 👀 Can predict ranges |
| **3.5 Bot Integration** | 📋 **NEXT** | Integrate opponent modeling for intelligent decisions | 🧠 Can think strategically |
| **4️⃣ CFR + RL Training** | 📋 Planned | Self-learning AI, optimal strategy training | 🤖🧠 Plays near-optimally |
| **5️⃣ Web Interface** | ✅ **COMPLETE** | FastAPI + React for real-time gameplay | 🎮 Playable now |
| **6️⃣ Deployment** | 📋 Planned | Production deployment, monitoring, CI/CD | 🚀 Scale to users |

### Current Bot Status: 🤖 **Check/Call Station (Exploitable)**
The bot currently uses a naive strategy (`backend/app.py` lines 356-384):
- Always checks if possible
- Always calls if can't check  
- **Never raises, never bluffs**
- Doesn't consider hand strength or opponent behavior

**Phase 3.5 will transform this into an intelligent player that uses equity calculations and opponent modeling!**

---

## ✅ Phase 3 Complete: Opponent Modeling + ML Predictor

Built a complete opponent modeling system that tracks player behavior and predicts hand ranges using both rule-based heuristics and machine learning.

- **Range Estimation**: Both rule-based (instant) and ML (87.3% accuracy)
- **Equity-Based Training**: Ranges grounded in poker mathematics, not arbitrary rules
- **HU-Calibrated**: Tuned for heads-up play (VPIP 48-72% vs 6-max's 18-45%)
- **Fast Predictions**: < 5ms per prediction
- **Hybrid System**: Uses ML when confident (>70%), falls back to rules otherwise

### 🤖 Trained Model Performance

**Model:** RandomForest with 100 trees  
**Training Data:** 10,000 equity-based samples (4 HU archetypes)  
**Accuracy:** 87.3% validation (88.1% training)  
**Size:** 3.7 MB  
**Speed:** < 5ms per prediction  

**Top Features (What the model learned):**
1. Action taken (call, bet, check, raise, fold) - 55%
2. Street (preflop, flop, turn, river) - 15%
3. Bet sizing - 7%
4. Board texture - 5%

**Range Categories Predicted:**
- Ultra-tight: QQ+,AKs
- Tight: JJ+,AQs+,AKo
- Tight-medium: TT+,ATs+,AJo+,KQs
- Medium: 99+,A9s+,ATo+,KJs+,KQo
- Medium-wide: 77+,A2s+,A9o+,KTs+,QJs+
- Wide: 55+,A2s+,A5o+,K5s+,K9o+,QTs+

### 💡 How It Works

```python
from pypokerengine.opponent_modeling import (
    PlayerProfile, RangePredictor, EquityCalculator
)

# 1. Track opponent
profile = PlayerProfile(player_id="villain")
profile.update_preflop_action(action="raise", is_raise=True)
# After 100 hands: VPIP=58%, PFR=38% → "Balanced HU player"

# 2. Predict their range
predictor = RangePredictor.load("models/range_model.pkl")
prediction = predictor.predict(profile, action="raise", street=PREFLOP)
# → Range: "JJ+,AQs+,AKo" (Confidence: 99.4%)

# 3. Calculate your equity vs their range
calc = EquityCalculator()
equity = calc.calculate_equity(
    hero_hand="AhKh",
    villain_range=prediction.to_hand_range(),
    board=board
)
# → Your AK has 45% equity vs their range

# 4. Make intelligent decision
if equity > 0.55:
    return "raise"  # Value bet
elif equity > pot_odds:
    return "call"   # Profitable
else:
    return "fold"   # Not enough equity
```

### 🎯 Outcomes Achieved

✅ Bot can track: "Opponent has 58% VPIP, 38% PFR → Balanced HU player"  
✅ Bot can predict: "Given their stats + this raise → JJ+,AQs+,AKo (99% confident)"  
✅ Bot can calculate: "My AK has 45% equity vs their range"  
✅ Foundation ready for Phase 3.5 intelligent decision-making  

### 📊 Data Quality

**Training Data Characteristics:**
- 10,000 samples balanced across 4 HU archetypes
- Each sample: 32 features + equity value + range category
- Equity mean: 0.498 (realistic distribution)
- Action distribution: 34% check, 22% bet, 17% call, 15% raise, 12% fold
- All based on **real equity calculations** (not random!)

**HU Archetypes (Calibrated for 2-player poker):**
- HU Tight-Aggressive: VPIP=48%, PFR=32%, AF=3.0
- HU Balanced: VPIP=58%, PFR=38%, AF=2.5  
- HU Loose-Aggressive: VPIP=68%, PFR=44%, AF=2.8
- HU Calling Station: VPIP=72%, PFR=25%, AF=1.3

## 🚧 Next: Phase 3.5 - Bot Integration

Transform the bot from "check/call station" to intelligent player by integrating equity calculations + opponent modeling.

### 📋 What Needs to Be Built

### 📋 Planned Components

**Strategy Module (`strategy/equity_strategy.py`)**
```python
class EquityBasedStrategy:
    def decide_action(self, game_state, opponent_model):
        # 1. Get opponent's estimated range
        villain_range = opponent_model.estimate_range(...)
        
        # 2. Calculate our equity vs their range
        equity = equity_calc.calculate_equity(
            our_hand, 
            villain_range=villain_range,
            board=game_state.board
        )
        
        # 3. Calculate pot odds
        pot_odds = call_amount / (pot + call_amount)
        
        # 4. Make decision
        if equity > 0.70:
            return 'raise'  # Value bet
        elif equity > pot_odds + 0.10:
            return 'call'   # Profitable call
        elif random.random() < 0.15:
            return 'raise'  # Bluff
        else:
            return 'fold'   # Not enough equity
```

**Decision Logic:**
- **Raise for value**: equity > 70%
- **Call**: equity > pot odds + margin
- **Bluff**: Occasionally with medium equity (15% frequency)
- **Fold**: Insufficient equity

### 📝 Integration Checklist

**What's Ready to Use:**
- ✅ `PlayerProfile` - Track opponent stats across hands
- ✅ `HandHistory` - Record all actions
- ✅ `RangePredictor` - Trained ML model (87.3% accuracy)
- ✅ `EquityCalculator` - Fast equity vs ranges
- ✅ `HybridRangeEstimator` - Combined rules + ML

**What Needs Integration:**
- [ ] Add `PlayerProfile` tracking to `backend/app.py`
- [ ] Update opponent profiles after each action
- [ ] Replace check/call bot with equity-based strategy
- [ ] Add SQLite for persistent opponent tracking (optional)
- [ ] Integrate range prediction in decision-making
- [ ] Calculate equity vs predicted ranges
- [ ] Implement intelligent bet sizing

**Integration Points:**
1. **After opponent acts**: Update their `PlayerProfile`
2. **When bot decides**: 
   - Predict opponent range
   - Calculate equity vs range
   - Make decision based on equity + pot odds
3. **After hand ends**: Store hand history, update stats

### 🎯 Expected Outcomes

After Phase 3.5:
- ✅ Bot makes +EV decisions based on equity
- ✅ Adapts to opponent tendencies (tight vs loose)
- ✅ Can value bet, bluff catch, and fold appropriately
- ✅ **First truly playable intelligent bot!**
- ✅ Bot intelligence: **6/10** (competent player level)

---

## 🚧 Upcoming: Phase 4 - CFR/RL Training

Train the bot to play near-optimally through self-play and reinforcement learning.

### 📋 Planned Approaches

**4A. Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR)**
- Bot plays millions of hands against itself
- At each decision point, uses equity calculator to evaluate outcomes
- Tracks regret for each action
- Converges to Nash equilibrium strategy
- Result: Unexploitable baseline strategy

**4B. Reinforcement Learning (PPO/A2C)**
- Bot learns through trial and error
- State: Hand strength, opponent stats, pot odds, equity
- Actions: Fold, call, raise (with size)
- Rewards: Chips won/lost
- Uses Phase 2 equity + Phase 3 opponent modeling as state features

**4C. Hybrid Approach**
- Start with CFR for optimal baseline
- Fine-tune with RL for opponent exploitation
- Use opponent modeling to identify weaknesses
- Adapt strategy dynamically

### 🎯 Expected Outcomes

After Phase 4:
- Bot plays near-optimal poker (approaching GTO)
- Can exploit opponent mistakes when detected
- Robust against human exploitation attempts
- **Bot intelligence: 9/10** (expert player level)
